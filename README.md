# Todoey
In this SwiftUI application, I created a To-Do application that allows users to keep track of what they need to get done!
Users are able to add new To-Do categories with color customization while also crossing off and adding tasks within each category. 

After creating this application, I gained a greater understanding of how to connect different views using @State and @Binding variables, utilize user input to change UI, and utilize NavigationStack and NavigationLinks within my views.
